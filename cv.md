## About Me

My path is long and thorny. My goal is to gain knowledge and skills as a front-end developer. My strength is the desire to understand the subject matter.

> Scientia est clara cognitio veritatis, illustratio mentis

## Skills and Proficiency:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* VSCode
* JavaScript
* Adobe Photoshop

## Code example:

``` 
let targetNumber = Number(prompt("Enter the number for which you want to calculate the factorial:"));
let currentNumber = 0;
let factorial;
if (targetNumber >= 0 && (targetNumber % 1 === 0)){
  factorial = ++ currentNumber;
  while (currentNumber <= targetNumber) {
    factorial *= currentNumber;
    currentNumber++;
  }
  console.log("The factorial of " + targetNumber + " is " + factorial);
} else {
  console.log ("Incorrect data entry.");
}
```
